## How It Works

### 🎤 Voice Input
You speak commands naturally to JARVIS. The microphone captures your voice and converts it to text using Google Speech Recognition API.

### 🤖 AI Processing
The text is sent to Google Gemini API, which understands your intent and generates appropriate responses.

### 🚀 Command Execution
JARVIS executes your command on your computer - launching apps, searching the web, controlling system settings, or performing automations.

### 📱 Mobile Control
You can also control JARVIS from your Android mobile device using the companion app.

### 💾 Memory
All interactions are logged in a local database so JARVIS remembers your past commands and preferences.
